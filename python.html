                                In scientific terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language, specifically for web and app creation, with embedded dynamic semantics. 
                                In the area of Rapid Application Growth, it is highly desirable because it provides dynamic typing and options for dynamic binding.<br>
                                Python is fairly straightforward, but it's simple to learn as it includes a special syntax that focuses on readability. Much simpler than other languages, developers can read and interpret Python code. 
                                This in essence lowers the expense of maintenance and development of the software because it encourages teams to work collaboratively without major obstacles to language and expertise.</br>

                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">WHAT PYTHON IS USED FOR?</h2>
                                Python is a programming language for general purposes, which is another way to suggest that it can be used for virtually anything. 
                                Most notably, it is an encoded language , meaning that the written text is not directly converted at runtime into a computer-readable format. 
                                Whereas, before the software is even executed, most programming languages perform this conversion. This kind of language is also known as a 
                                "scripting language" since it was originally designed for frivolous tasks to be used.<br>
                                Since its launch, the concept of a "scripting language" has changed significantly, since Python is now used to write large, advertising-style applications rather than just banal ones. 
                                With the internet population growing, this reliance on Python has grown even more. A vast number of web apps and platforms, like Google's search engine, YouTube, and the New York Stock Exchange's (NYSE) 
                                web-oriented transaction framework, depend on Python.</br>

                                -Python is incredibly basic and fast to understand, so it's easy to read or easy to learn Python. It closely resembles the English language, so it has one of Python's greatest advantages.<br>
                                -Python provides programming orientation, allowing for polymorphism and inheritance. The shareable categories are used by Python users, so code can be reusable and the protection mechanism can also be provided by abstracting knowledge.<br>
                                -Python is mainly used in small and large online or offline initiatives which is used to construct GUI that stands for Graphical User Interface, but it is also used for desktop applications, so we have game development, so Tkinter is the standard python GUI library, so python provides a quick and easy method of creating GUI programs and applications when combined with Tkinter.<br>
                                -Python can handle plenty of an immense amount of data.<br>
                                -In the last two years, Python has been very popular and the python programmers earn the highest salaries.</br>
