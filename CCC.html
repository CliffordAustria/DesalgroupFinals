                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">WHAT IS C#?</h2>
                                In 2000, microsoft introduced C #. It was designed to meet the rising need for operating systems that can not be fulfilled by Visual Basic(VB) and C++. 
                                The best features in Java and C++ was adopted by its architecture. As a consequence, developers who are well versed in C and C++ will quickly move to C #.

                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">WHAT IS C# USED FOR?</h2>
                                C # is a programming language for general purposes used to build various types of programs and applications. 
                                There are three fields where it is widely used, although it is particularly versatile:<br>
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Web Application Development</h2>
                                -You will also use the C # programming language irrespective of the platform. You may use the .NET framework or other open-source platforms to create interactive websites and mobile apps.<br>
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Windows Applications</h2>
                                -For Microsoft, Microsoft developed C #. So, in building windows programs, there is no doubt why it is popular. It makes the process of creation quick, and features such as the collection of C # garbage perform well.<br>
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Games</h2>
                                -Developers in the games industry use the C # programming language. In creating fan-favorite games, this vocabulary is especially robust. The Unity game engine is also developed using C++ and C #, one of today's most popular game engines.
                                 To create video games, game developers use game engines like Unity. It has more than a billion users who are involved. It's still a reliable forum for the world's 1.5 million daily users. Award-winning games and AR / VR experiences continue to be created by these committed users.</br>

                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">THE ADVANTAGES OF C#:</h2>
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">-Faster Development Time</h2>
                                -Statically typed and easy to read, reducing the time for debugging<br>
                                -A large library of high-level features similar to other languages such as Java and C++<br>
                                -Provides simplicity and performance and lets programmers write dynamic code stacks.<br>
                                -A broad memory bank to decrease production time and to minimize time-to - market.</br>
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">-Low Learning Curve</h2>
                                Programmers, mostly full-stack developers, preferred the language of C # programming. It does not only save production time, but it has a low learning process as well. 
                                Compared to other programming languages, developers devote less time learning C #. New developers and others who wish to learn a new language are benefited by its accessibility 
                                and easy-to-use characteristics.
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">-High Scalability</h2>
                                Simple-to-maintain and scalable operating systems are necessary to build applications. C # is a language for programming that has these attributes. The strict design of its static coding makes programs compatible in a stable manner. 
                                This makes it easier for developers to make quick improvements and easy maintenance.
                                <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">-Huge Community Support</h2>
                                Since C # was developed by tech giant Microsoft, there is no doubt as to why it has huge community support. Getting a community is important in the field of software development. It's where creators will look for assistance and ideas. 
                                Programming languages aren't a dedicated helpline or IT support network or service. In the same area of interest, developers depend on others.
