                            <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">THE HISTORY</h2>
                            An algorithm developed by Ada Lovelace in 1883 was the first-ever programming language. 
                            For Charles Babbage's Analytical engine, Ada Lovelace developed this algorithm. 
                            This algorithm was intended to compute Bernoulli numbers. In 1936, for the first time, 
                            Alonzo Church and Alan Turing specialized in machine codes. Lambda calculus was represented 
                            in a systematic manner by the Church.<br>
                            </br>
                            <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
                            It was in 1949 that the first ever high-level electronic computer programming language was developed. 
                            Fast Code, originally known as short code and introduced by William F Schmidt, was suggested by John Mauchly. 
                            The first usable programming language was called Shortcode. It was expressed in a human-comprehensible mathematical language. 
                            Yet there was a great downside. Any time it runs, a program has to be converted into machine code.<br>
                            Autocode was greater than its rivals, but its success nevertheless struggled to gain. The first popular programming language 
                            that was developed by a team at IBM in 1954 was FORTRAN. It is the oldest language for high-level programming that is still in use.<br>
                            There was always time to come out with high-level languages like Java , C, and C++. But in 1958, the Technical Committee for Research 
                            and Scientific Use established their starting point. A language known as Algol was developed by them. Algol is somehow based on Java 
                            and many other high-level languages.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-post-title">THE INTERNET</h2>  
                            The era of the internet started at the end of the 1980s. A big key point in the programming language universe was the exponential development of the internet. 
                            Javascript was developed in 1995 as one of the most significant and most commonly used programming languages today. In just 10 days, Brendan Eich built it. 
                            Earlier, no one in the programming community, even though Javascript would become such a big thing. This explains why no one at the time paid attention to JavaScript.
                            Today, it is one of the most popular programming languages, and almost every website is based on javascript that exists today. It is one of the World Wide Web 's 
                            core innovations, with CSS and HTML being the other two.<br>
                            Java was another significant high-level programming language that came out of the 1990s. There is something known as Java in the real world, everyone relevant to computing, 
                            even a little understands. But it was initially created for cable boxes and mobile computers. Yet it has changed so much that it is everywhere today. From the World Wide Web 
                            to tablets and servers, and even parking meters. Java is the most common language for programming today, no doubt.<br>
                            Up until 1991, programming languages such as C were fantastic. But in many programming languages, it still seems hard to write code. The syntax becomes too complicated often, 
                            even for skilled programmers. Then, in 1991, Guido Van Rossum developed a programming language that was very simple to use. He called it Python because he liked the Monty 
                            Python British comedy community so much. In the coming years, Python went on to become a very popular language.<br>

                            Java was initially meant for virtual broadcasting, but at the point it was too advanced for the digital cable television market. 
                            Java 's history continues with the Green Squad. This project was started by the Java team members (also known as the Green Team) 
                            to develop a language for interactive devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. It was, however, ideal for internet programming. 
                            Later, Netscape introduced Java programming.

                                Swift 's development was initiated by Chris Lattner with other programmers in 2010, 
                                i.e. At Apple: Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, and Joe Groff. Objective-C, 
                                Rust, Haskell, Ruby , Python, C #, CLU, and several other programming languages were 
                                taken from Swift's simple concept.

                                The creators of R. include Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemen. In reality, R is based on 
                                an older programming language named S that dates back to the 1970s. Ihaka and Gentlemen 
                                are creating their own programming language in New Zealand while working together. Several 
                                individuals joined the effort to further develop it with the publication of R in the early 1990's.

                                The Go programming language was released by Google in late 2007. It is conceived as a response to 
                                some of Google's software infrastructure development issues. C++, Java , and Python are the pillars 
                                of the language. The following subsections outline the aims of the Go design.
